# tt_picore

Work in progress to setup a shell script to install & configure a terminal tedium on picore


Get [Pi Core](http://tinycorelinux.net/9.x/armv6/releases/RPi/)

Helpful instruction on writing images [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) if you need help

Do this part with the pi connected to a monitor & keyboard or via ssh.  Either way unless / until you setup the wireless you will need a wired ethernet connection available for the pi.

Boot the pi with the SD card you just made

I like to [Setup Wireless](https://iotbytes.wordpress.com/make-raspberry-pi-3-built-in-wifi-module-work-with-picore/) right away but you don't have to bother with this step if it's not important to you.  The WIFI on the pi doesn't seem to have much range once it's inside my eurorack case.
